In index.html, there should initially be a mario and a tophat and a quest log just like in lab 5. After picking up the top hat, a coin should appear above the highest platform. The intersections are a little better than last time, but the game still starts to run slow after a little while, so there's something I need to do better. But for thi lab, I added tweening to mario at the beginning of the game, and tweening to the coin when mario reaches it.
